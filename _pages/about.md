Blake Anderson is a San Diego-based writer whose interests vary from subway planning to strategy games to Byzantine history (with a hefty serving of fiction fandom and language geekery in between). He enjoys writing both fiction and non-fiction.

Blake grew up on an alpaca farm in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, but went on to live in a variety of places, from Taipei to Bologna, Pristina, Vienna, and the exotic U.S. state of New Jersey. He absorbed bits and pieces of the places where he lived, and tries to bring those perspectives into the fantasy worlds that he creates. When he's not writing, Blake and his partner spend their days traveling, cooking, painting landscapes, and playing games on the Switch.

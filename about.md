  <p>
    Blake Anderson was raised in the Appalachian Mountains by avid fantasy-reading parents and spent untold hours of his childhood doodling maps and stories. His studies of Byzantine history and international relations influenced his passion for political thrillers, although perhaps less bloody than Constantinopleâ€™s. Following a few years in urban planning, he decided to pursue his true loves of map-making and writing.

    After living in Taiwan as a transportation planner, Blake now resides in sunny San Diego with his husband, Kaito, and their neurotic cat, Uri. When not buried in ArcGIS Pro or Scrivener, he loves giving away his ceramic creations to his reluctant friends and spending time at the beach.

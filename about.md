Blake Anderson was raised in the Appalachian Mountains by avid fantasy-reading parents. His studies of Byzantine history and international relations influenced his passion for political thrillers, although perhaps less bloody than Constantinopleâ€™s. Following a few years in urban planning, he decided to pursue his love of writing. He published non-fiction articles on Medium for six years and recently submitted two queer short stories to the annual Tennessee Williams & New Orleans Literary Festival.

After living in Taiwan as a transportation planner, Blake now resides in sunny San Diego with his husband, Kaito, and their cuddly cat, Uri. When not buried in Scrivener, he loves giving away his ceramic creations to his reluctant friends and spending time at the beach.
